UCLA Softball Rachel Garcia did it all this year. Impressive performance after impressive performance, the Bruins starter led her team to their first a National title after almost a decade, while also collecting individual accolades. 
Garcia notched her second USA Softball Player of the Year award, becoming only the third woman in almost two decades to win it back-to-back. It was one hell of a season.

After watching the dual-threat throw a 173-pitches shutout (she also walked it off at the plate on extras), I decided to take a look at how good the pitcher's year really was compared to other great pitching seasons.
